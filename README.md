# Implementation of GANs
Implementating and analyzing the current works on GANs.

## Introduction 
The Generative in **GANs** describes the statistical models that contrasts with *discriminative* models.

The first step towards getting into GANs to obtain a comprehensive knowledge of Autoencoders. My works on autoencoders can be obtained [here](https://github.com/aman190202/AutoEncoders) 

## Requirements (MacOS ARM)
1. tensorflow-macos
2. tensorflow-metal (optional)

## How to run
